\par Self-control is an interesting field of behavioral research and has 
neurological facets that can be captured using functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI). Relating a subjectâ€™s ability to control themselves to an area of
 the brain or focusing on understanding what connects self control to 
neurological activity has been the focus of many studies. Our goal is to 
reproduce and extend the analysis for a Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) study 
described in \textit{The Development and Generality of Self-Control} 
\cite{CohenSelfControl}.
