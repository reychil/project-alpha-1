\par Self control is an interesting field of research with neurological facets that can be captured using the fMRI method. Relating a subjectâ€™s ability to control themselves to an area of the brain or focusing on understanding what connects self control to neurological activity has been the focus of many studies. Our goal is to reproduce and extend the analysis for a Balloon Analogue Risk Task study found in \textit{The Development and Generality of Self-Control} \cite{../CohenSelfControl}.
