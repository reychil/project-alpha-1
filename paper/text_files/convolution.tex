\par \indent Our study is structured around event-related neurological stimulus, not block stimulus as was discussed as the in-class example. We predicted the hemoglobin response (HR) related to this type of neurological stimulus, since the methods in class were much better for block stimulus. Moreover, our stimulus (as is the case in event-related stimulus studies) was not evenly split. We developed a few other functions to take this into account, and will likely implement additional procedures in the future.

\par The three approaches that we are in the process of exploring address modeling the HR from the neural stimulus. The first two have already been completed. \textbf{(1)} We first implemented the standard block-stimulus paradigm related \texttt{np.convolve} function (which failed to take into account the non-trivial times of stimulus). \texttt{np.convolve} utilities FFT (Fast Fourier Transforms). \textbf{(2)} Next, we developed a function that does not utilize FFT, but allows for discontinuous stimulus events (discontinuous being non-uniform stimulus timing in this scenario). We used a continuous HR function to model the response (whereas \texttt{np.convolve} uses a discrete HR function).\textbf{(3)} Our next project will be to utilize the strength of FFTs by splitting up the time into 60 milliseconds intervals (a very small time metric), and then uses \texttt{np.convolve} and some rounding of the stimulus response occurrences to get another candidate for the hemoglobin response related to the neurological stimulus. This procedure would take advantage of FFTs, and would not be hindered by assumptions of time, since the HR model is not extremely precise and has a good amount of variance.
    
\par For \textbf{(2)} and \textbf{(3)} we had to scale back down to the image capturing time frame (2 seconds) [Figure \ref{fig:convolution}].
