\par \indent While very much still a work in progress, our analysis thus far 
includes methods for both data processing and modeling voxel time courses. 
Prior to doing any serious analysis, we had to smooth the data spatially for 
each subject and also generate a reasonable convolved time course based on 
event-related neurological stimuli with non-constant intervals. A basic but 
nevertheless important model to consider is linear regression. We implemented 
both simple and multiple regression models at the individual subject level, and 
performed hypothesis testing on the resulting coefficients for each voxel (and 
event condition, in the multiple regression case). Finally, we explored some 
additional methods that may be of interest or use moving forward, including 
principal components analysis and modeling individual volumes as a time series.
