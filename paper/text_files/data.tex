\par \indent BART data consists of the average number of tpumps for each balloon, how many explosions of the balloons, and how much money was earned across each trial for each respective participant. There are four different behavioral variables: the average number of pumps for each balloon, the average across each run, the number of exploded balloons, and ultimately the number of total trials. Within each variable, there are three model conditions: events for inflating the balloon (excluding the very last inflation of each trial), the last inflation before an explosion, and the event when the participant cashes out.
