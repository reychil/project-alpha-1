\par \indent The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) study data consists of the average number of pumps for each balloon, how times the subject elected to explode the balloon, and how much money was earned across each trial for each respective participant. There are four different behavioral variables: the average number of pumps for each balloon, the average across each run, the number of exploded balloons, and the number of total trials. Within each variable, there are three model conditions: events for inflating the balloon (excluding the very last inflation of each trial), the last inflation before an explosion, and the event when the participant cashes out. There were 24 subjects with purportedly "clean" data.
