\par \indent The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) measures risk-taking 
behavior by presenting participants with a computerized balloon. The 
participant can earn money incrementally by pumping up the balloon, but after 
an unknown threshold, the balloon will explode. At any time, the participant 
elect to cash out his or her earnings, but doing so eliminates the potential to 
gain additional money through pumps. If the balloon explodes, the participant 
loses all of the money for the trial. For this study, BART and fMRI data for 24 
subjects was collected. The mean age of the subjects was 20.8, and ten of the 
subjects were female. Four behavioral variables were recorded for each subject: 
the average number of pumps for each balloon, the average amount of money 
earned across runs, the number of exploded balloons, and the number of trials. 
There were also three model conditions: events for inflating the balloon 
(excluding the very last inflation of each trial), the last inflation before an 
explosion, and the event of cashing out (the balloon explosion was not included 
as an event). Of interest for our work is the blood-oxygen-level dependent 
(BOLD) imaging data recorded for each subject during the course of task. Each 
subject's BOLD data was recorded as 64 by 64 image matrices in 34 slices, with 
a variable number of time points.
