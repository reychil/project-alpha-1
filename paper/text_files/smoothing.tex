% tex file for smoothing
\par \indent Due to the random nature of human subjects and their movements, a certain extent of smoothing must be performed on the spatial dataset so that the ‘noisy’ data can be cast off from the data that represent significant changes in blood flow in the brain. By doing so, researchers and anyone else investigating the data will be able to distinguish between non-brain scans versus actual brain scans. Each voxel of the brain is represented on a measure of blood flow intensity, and so a series of steps must be taken so that it is correctly convolved to most closely and accurately depict what was happening at a certain point in the brain at a certain time. After researching quite extensively, we decided to use a convolution involving a Gaussian kernel in order to smooth the three dimensional data. Originally, we were going to try and write a smoothing function from scratch, by implementing a rudimentary rudimentary average-over-neighbors method. However, discussions with mentors lead us to the scipy module called \texttt{ndimage.filters} that has a function that performs a Gaussian filter on n-dimensional data. This was exactly what we needed so rather than reinventing the wheel, we will be smoothing the data with this module.
