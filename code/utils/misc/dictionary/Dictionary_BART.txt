BART is task001.
# why: pumps = Balloons, we see that the behavior variables can come from "4.2.4 Behavioral Data Analysis" section.


behav variables: 
	NumPumps = "Average number of pumps for each balloon" # continous
	AmtWon = "amount of money won" - average across run
	NumExpl = "number of exploded balloons" # discrete
	NumTRs = number of trials

model conditions:
	cond001 = "the model included events for inflating the balloon (all but" 
		"the last inflation of each trial)"
	cond002 = "the last inflation before an explosion" (at the very least 
		 associated with explosions- length matches number of explosion)
	cond003 = "cashing out" ?
