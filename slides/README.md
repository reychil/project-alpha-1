## Progress report presentation

Use the above guide (link) to learn how to use pandoc with beamer to produce
slides.  I've made a template `progress.md` for you to modify.  I've also
added a `Makefile` with some recipes to build your slides and delete the
generated files.

## Final report presentation

Create a new file `final.md` and add appropriate entries to the `Makefile`.
